For DFS,
Template is to always pass the root value into the dfs funciton, and then in dfs function, during recursive case, add the left or right values into the variables
that need to be passed to lower stages in the tree.

Analyze if the answer needs to be bottom up or top down DFS to choose between preorder or post order traversal. If you need to get to the leaves first,
and then pipe up the solution upwards to parents, then use post order. 

For tree construction problems, draw out the recursion tree to double check after coding its right. In the helper function for these problems, 
keep indices left and right as variables.
